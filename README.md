# TimeYourWeb-stats
This script is probably useless for like the 99.9% of people who don't use the extension TimeYourWeb Time Tracker 
(especially since it only has 10k downloads), but anyway a problem i found on this extension is that you can only see
months per months the web activity but you can't see an overall one so as you can see here :

There is an option to download the month data as a CSV, then using the script it can detect all the files with the corresponding
syntaxe and then ask you what site you want to check you'r time spent on, the output is in hours.
